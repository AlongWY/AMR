Borrowed from [Oneplus/tamr](https://github.com/Oneplus/tamr/tree/master/amr_aligner/smatch) with slight modifications.

This uses Cython to re-implement the smatch script, which is super faster compared to [the ordinary version](https://github.com/snowblink14/smatch)


Usage: `sh compute_smatch.sh test.txt ref.txt`
